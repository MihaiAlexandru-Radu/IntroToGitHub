# IntroToGitHub
Version Control essentially tracks changes to files. Different Branches have different changes, which are then merged into one GitHub Repository. Generally, these branches are merged after pull requests, where teams can review changes and potential merge conflicts. When multiple people work on one repository, they do so by pushing and committing.

## Usage 

There isn't really any specific *usage* for this GitHub. I think that the **most** important thing is just to add things that you find cool. This can mean:
- Something cool you found on the internet that you would want to use later.
  - It can be **anything** as long as it's cool
- Something interesting that you made that you want to show other people.
