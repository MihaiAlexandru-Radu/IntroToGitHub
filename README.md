# IntroToGitHub
Version Control essentially tracks changes to files. Different Branches have different changes, which are then merged into one GitHub Repository. Generally, these branches are merged after pull requests, where teams can review changes and potential merge conflicts. When multiple people work on one repository, they do so by pushing and committing.
